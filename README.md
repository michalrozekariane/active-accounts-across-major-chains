# Active Accounts Across Major Chains

This repository contains the SQL queries used to extract key user activity metrics across major Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain networks. The queries support a broader analysis of ecosystem engagement from January to June 2025.

## Purpose

The dataset generated by these queries was used to measure and compare:

- Daily active accounts
- Daily new accounts
- Total daily transactions

These metrics form the basis for evaluating usage patterns, ecosystem health, and retention across multiple networks.

## Scope

Queries were executed for the following chains only:

- Aptos
- Base
- Polygon
- Starknet
- Solana

## Project Structure

The `queries/` directory contains chain-specific folders, each holding the SQL scripts used to extract:
- `active-wallets.sql` â€” daily count of active wallets
- `new-wallets.sql` â€” daily count of newly active wallets
- `daily-transactions.sql` â€” total daily transactions

## Usage

These SQL files are intended to be run directly on their respective platforms (Dune, Flipside, or BigQuery). Make sure to adjust any time filters or project-specific table names as needed.

## Data Sources

The data was collected using the following platforms:

- [Dune](https://dune.com/) â€” primary source for chains: Aptos, Base, Polygon, and StarkNet  
- [Flipside Crypto](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/) â€” used for Solana  
- [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) â€” used for Aptos
